# Production Readiness Checklist

This checklist provides a set of recommendations for configuring your MoCoPr server for production use.

## Security

*   [ ] **Enable Authentication:** Use the `AuthMiddleware` to protect your server with API keys or other authentication mechanisms.
*   [ ] **Validate Inputs:** Always validate inputs from clients to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities. Use the `Utils::validate_*` functions where appropriate.
*   [ ] **Restrict URI Schemes:** When using resources, use the `new_validated` method to restrict the allowed URI schemes to prevent access to unauthorized resources.
*   [ ] **Limit File System Access:** If your server provides access to the file system, ensure that it is properly sandboxed and that clients cannot access sensitive files.
*   [ ] **Use HTTPS:** When using the HTTP or WebSocket transports, always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.

## Monitoring

*   [ ] **Enable Monitoring:** Use the `with_monitoring` method on the `McpServerBuilder` to enable the monitoring system.
*   [ ] **Collect Metrics:** Use the `MetricsMiddleware` to collect metrics on request counts and response times.
*   [ ] **Set Up Logging:** Use the `LoggingMiddleware` to log requests and responses. Configure your logging backend to store logs in a central location for analysis.
*   [ ] **Implement Health Checks:** Implement a health check endpoint that can be used by your monitoring system to check the health of your server.

## Performance Tuning

*   [ ] **Enable `simd-json`:** For improved JSON parsing performance, enable the `simd-json-performance` feature in your `Cargo.toml` file.
*   [ ] **Use a Multi-threaded Runtime:** For high-concurrency workloads, enable the multi-threaded Tokio runtime using the `with_multi_threaded_runtime` method on the `McpServerBuilder`.
*   [ ] **Use Connection Pooling:** For tools and resources that make outbound HTTP requests, use a shared `reqwest::Client` to take advantage of connection pooling.
*   [ ] **Benchmark Your Server:** Use the benchmark suite to identify performance bottlenecks in your server and optimize them.

## Error Handling

*   [ ] **Implement a Graceful Shutdown:** Use the `shutdown` method on the `McpServer` to gracefully shut down your server.
*   [ ] **Use Structured Errors:** Use the `StructuredError` content type to return structured error information to clients.
*   [ ] **Handle Timeouts:** Use the `send_request_with_timeout` method on the `Session` to set timeouts for client requests.
*   [ ] **Implement Retries:** For recoverable errors, implement a retry mechanism on the client side.
